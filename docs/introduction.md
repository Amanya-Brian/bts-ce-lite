# Introduction
The tool is a minimal feature version of [BTS-CE](https://github.com/bodastage/bts-ce). Where as BTS-CE is server based and resource intensive, Boda-Lite is 
 intentionally light weight and designed to meet the needs of the engineer and run from their personal computers. As such, Boda-Lite is desktop based and supports Windows, Linux and Mac OSX. 

Boda-Lite is open source and licenced under the Apache 2.0 Licence; giving you the freedom to extend and enhance the tool to your needs. 
 The code is hosted on [github](https://github.com/bodastage/bts-ce-lite) and builds are run on [Travis-CI](https://travis-ci.org/bodastage/bts-ce-lite).
